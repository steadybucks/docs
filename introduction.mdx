## Key Features

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="wand-magic-sparkles" title="Agentic Architecture">
    SAGE deploys and runs AI agents that execute tasks from natural language commands. Say "Pay 5 SAGEUSD if I am on time" or "Bet 10 SAGEUSD it rains"—smart contracts deploy instantly.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="layer-group" title="Composable Agents">
    Agents build on agents endlessly, stacking innovations on one unbreakable network. This creates a powerful ecosystem where innovation compounds.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="users" title="Community-Driven Growth">
    People add agents, they bring data, and the system scales—everyone profits as it grows. SAGE blurs the distinction between developers and users, allowing anyone to deploy or use agents.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="money-bill-trend-up" title="Economic Model">
    The $SAGE token will secure the network, while SAGEUSD provides a stable entry point with a points program that rewards early adopters.
