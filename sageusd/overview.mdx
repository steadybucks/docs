## Initial Stablecoin Offering (ISO)

  <Accordion icon="users" title="Democratized Participation">
    Like ICOs, ISOs allow anyone to participate, not just accredited investors or venture capitalists.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="shield" title="Risk Mitigation">
    Unlike ICOs, participants hold a stable asset that can be redeemed at any time, eliminating downside risk.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="money-bill" title="Yield Generation">
    The reserves backing SAGEUSD generate yield, which funds the development of the SAGE world computer.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="handshake" title="Alignment of Interests">
    The ISO creates alignment between the project and its supporters, as both benefit from the growth of the ecosystem.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Note>
  SAGEUSD aims to become the first stablecoin to reach a market cap of $1 trillion, establishing itself as a cornerstone of the digital economy.
