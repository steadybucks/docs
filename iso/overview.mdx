## What is an Initial Stablecoin Offering?

An Initial Stablecoin Offering (ISO) is a new fundraising mechanism pioneered by SAGE. 
It combines the best aspects of traditional fundraising methods while eliminating their drawbacks,
creating a win-win situation for both the project and its supporters.

<Note>
  The ISO is a democratized fundraising mechanism like ICOs where everyone can participate, but without the downside risk as participants hold a regulated stablecoin that can be redeemed at any time.
</Note>

## How the ISO Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Stablecoin Creation">
    SAGEUSD, a regulated USD-backed stablecoin, is created with a 1:1 backing of US dollars
  </Step>
  <Step title="User Participation">
    Users acquire SAGEUSD through various channels, holding it in their own wallets
  </Step>
  <Step title="Reserve Management">
    The USD reserves backing SAGEUSD are managed to generate yield
  </Step>
  <Step title="Yield Allocation">
    The yield generated from the reserves is used to fund the development of the SAGE world computer
  </Step>
  <Step title="Points Program">
    SAGEUSD holders earn points that will convert to $SAGE tokens when the network launches
  </Step>
</Steps>
