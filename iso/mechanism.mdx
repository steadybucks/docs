## The ISO Mechanism Explained

The Initial Stablecoin Offering (ISO) is a novel fundraising mechanism that leverages the stability of stablecoins and the yield-generating potential of reserve assets to create a sustainable funding model for projects.

<Note>
  The ISO mechanism creates a win-win situation where participants hold a stable asset with no downside risk, while the project receives sustainable funding through yield generation.

## The ISO Flow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Stablecoin Creation">
    <div className="space-y-2">
      <p>SAGEUSD is created as an ERC-20 token on Ethereum, with each token backed 1:1 by USD held in reserve.</p>
      <div className="bg-gray-100 dark:bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
        <p className="font-mono text-sm">1 SAGEUSD = 1 USD in reserve</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </Step>
  <Step title="User Acquisition">
    <div className="space-y-2">
      <p>Users acquire SAGEUSD through various channels:</p>

        <li>Money market funds</li>
        <li>Other secure, regulated financial instruments</li>

## Reserve Management

The management of USD reserves is a critical component of the ISO mechanism:

      <p>The reserves are allocated to various yield-generating instruments to maximize returns while maintaining security and regulatory compliance:</p>

      </ul>
      <p>This regulatory approach provides confidence to users and authorities alike.</p>
    </div>

## Scaling the ISO

As the SAGEUSD market cap grows, the ISO mechanism becomes increasingly powerful:

<Frame>
  <div className="bg-gray-100 dark:bg-gray-800 p-6 rounded-lg">
    <h3 className="text-lg font-bold mb-4">ISO Scaling Example</h3>
    <div className="space-y-4">
      <div className="flex justify-between">
        <span>Initial SAGEUSD Market Cap:</span>
        <span className="font-mono">$100M</span>
      </div>
      <div className="flex justify-between">
        <span>Annual Yield Rate:</span>
        <span className="font-mono">3%</span>
      </div>
      <div className="flex justify-between">
        <span>Initial Annual Yield:</span>
        <span className="font-mono">$3M</span>
      </div>
      <div className="border-t border-gray-300 dark:border-gray-600 pt-4">
        <div className="flex justify-between">
          <span>SAGEUSD Market Cap Growth to:</span>
          <span className="font-mono">$1B</span>
        </div>
        <div className="flex justify-between">
          <span>New Annual Yield:</span>
          <span className="font-mono">$30M</span>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div className="border-t border-gray-300 dark:border-gray-600 pt-4">
        <div className="flex justify-between">
          <span>SAGEUSD Market Cap Growth to:</span>
          <span className="font-mono">$10B</span>
        </div>
        <div className="flex justify-between">
          <span>New Annual Yield:</span>
          <span className="font-mono">$300M</span>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</Frame>

This scaling mechanism creates a virtuous cycle: as more users adopt SAGEUSD, more funding becomes available for development, which enhances the SAGE ecosystem, attracting more users, and so on.
