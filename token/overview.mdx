## What is the $SAGE Token?

The $SAGE token is the native token of the SAGE world computer. It serves as the primary medium of exchange, governance mechanism, and security layer for the network.

<Note>
  $SAGE has a fixed supply with no inflation, unlike other networks such as Solana. Network fees and yield from SAGEUSD are used to compensate node providers.

## Core Functions

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Network Security" icon="shield-check" color="#0891b2">
    Node providers must bond $SAGE to participate in the network. Going offline or engaging in malicious behavior results in slashing the bond.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Agent Deployment" icon="rocket" color="#7c3aed">
    $SAGE is required to deploy AI agents to the network, creating a sustainable economy for developers and users.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Transaction Fees" icon="money-bill-transfer" color="#059669">
    Network fees (similar to gas fees) must be paid in $SAGE, creating consistent demand for the token.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Governance" icon="landmark" color="#c2410c">
    $SAGE holders can participate in governance decisions that shape the future of the network.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Value Exchange">
    $SAGE facilitates value exchange between users, developers, and node operators
  </Step>
  <Step title="Resource Allocation">
    $SAGE helps allocate computational resources efficiently across the network
  </Step>
  <Step title="Incentive Alignment">
    $SAGE aligns incentives between all participants in the ecosystem
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Token Distribution

<Note>
  Detailed information about the token distribution, including allocations for various stakeholders, vesting schedules, and release mechanisms, will be announced closer to the network launch.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="SAGEUSD Points">
    A significant portion of the SAGE token supply will be allocated to SAGEUSD holders through the points program, rewarding early supporters of the ecosystem.
    Points convert to SAGE tokens and vest immediately. Conversion rate will be announced closer to the network launch but
    will be proportional to the market cap of the SAGEUSD stablecoin. 
    
    <Note>
      High SAGEUSD market cap will result in higher conversion rate, potentially up to 70% of the total SAGE token supply.
    </Note>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Team & Development">
    Allocations for the core team, future development, and ecosystem growth will ensure the long-term sustainability of the project.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Community & Ecosystem">
    Funds allocated for community initiatives, grants, and ecosystem development to foster innovation and adoption.
