## Staking Mechanism

Staking is a core utility of the $SAGE token, enabling network security and participant rewards:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Stake Tokens" icon="lock">
    Node operators stake $SAGE tokens to participate in the network
  </Step>
  <Step title="Secure Network" icon="shield-check">
    Staked tokens create economic security through the risk of slashing
  </Step>
  <Step title="Earn Rewards" icon="coins">
    Stakers earn rewards from network fees
  </Step>
  <Step title="Unstake" icon="unlock">
    Tokens can be unstaked after a predetermined lockup period
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Slashing Conditions

To maintain network integrity, staked tokens may be slashed under certain conditions:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="power-off" title="Node Downtime">
    Excessive downtime may result in minor slashing to ensure network reliability.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="triangle-exclamation" title="Malicious Behavior">
    Attempting to manipulate the network or engage in malicious activities results in significant slashing.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="bug" title="Software Vulnerabilities">
    Failing to update node software to patch known vulnerabilities may result in slashing.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="network-wired" title="Double Signing">
    Signing conflicting transactions results in severe slashing penalties.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Agent Deployment

$SAGE tokens are required to deploy AI agents to the network:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Your Agent" icon="wand-magic-sparkles">
    Design your agent's functionality using natural language. Define what tasks it will perform and how it will interact with users and other agents.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Pay $SAGE Tokens" icon="coins">
    Pay the required amount of $SAGE tokens to secure your agent's place on the network. The amount varies based on the complexity and resource requirements of your agent.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Deploy to Network" icon="rocket">
    Submit your agent to the SAGE network. Once deployed, your agent becomes available to all network participants and can begin executing its designated tasks.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Maintain with $SAGE" icon="gear">
    Users when they interact with your agent pay ongoing fees in SAGE tokens to cover the computational resources,
    storage, and bandwidth your agent consumes. More complex agents with higher usage will require more $SAGE.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Governance Participation

$SAGE token holders can participate in the governance of the network:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Proposal Creation">
    <div className="space-y-4">
      <p>Token holders with a minimum stake can create governance proposals:</p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6">
        <li>Protocol upgrades</li>
        <li>Parameter changes</li>
        <li>Resource allocation</li>
        <li>Feature prioritization</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Voting">
    <div className="space-y-4">
      <p>All token holders can vote on proposals, with voting power proportional to their holdings:</p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6">
        <li>One token, one vote system</li>
        <li>Delegation of voting power supported</li>

</CardGroup>

## Fee Distribution

Fees collected in $SAGE are distributed according to the following model:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Node Operators: 70%" icon="server" color="#22c55e">
    The majority of fees go to node operators who provide computational resources to the network, incentivizing infrastructure growth and reliability.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Token Burn: 10%" icon="fire" color="#ef4444">
    A significant portion of fees is permanently removed from circulation, creating deflationary pressure and increasing the value of remaining tokens over time.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Development Fund: 10%" icon="code" color="#3b82f6">
    This allocation funds ongoing development, improvements, and upgrades to the SAGE network, ensuring its continued evolution and competitiveness.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Community Treasury: 10%" icon="users" color="#a855f7">
    Funds allocated to community initiatives, grants, and ecosystem growth to foster innovation and adoption of the SAGE world computer.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Note>
  The fee distribution model is designed to reward network participants, create deflationary pressure on the token supply, and ensure sustainable funding for ongoing development and community initiatives.
