---

## Supply Mechanics

The $SAGE token is designed with a deflationary economic model to ensure long-term value accrual as the network grows.
This is where the initial stablecoin offering shines. SAGEUSD yield can be used to compensate node providers 
instead of the inflationary model of other networks.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Fixed Supply" icon="coins" color="#eab308">
    $SAGE has a fixed maximum supply, creating scarcity as adoption increases
  </Card>
  <Card title="No Inflation" icon="chart-line-down" color="#059669">
    Unlike many other networks, $SAGE does not have built-in inflation
  </Card>
  <Card title="Burn Mechanism" icon="fire" color="#ef4444">
    A portion of $SAGE tokens are burned when they are used to pay for network fees
  </Card>
  <Card title="Staking Lockups" icon="lock" color="#64748b">
    Staked tokens are locked, reducing circulating supply and increasing scarcity
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Demand Drivers

Multiple mechanisms create sustained demand for the $SAGE token:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="server" title="Node Operation">
    Node operators must stake $SAGE to participate in the network, creating demand from infrastructure providers.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="robot" title="Agent Deployment">
    People must use $SAGE to deploy agents to the network. As more agents are created, demand for the token increases.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="money-bill" title="Transaction Fees">
    All transactions on the network require $SAGE for fees, creating consistent demand proportional to network usage.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="users" title="Governance Participation">
    $SAGE holders can participate in governance decisions, creating demand from users who want to influence the network's future.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Value Accrual Mechanisms

The $SAGE token is designed to capture value as the SAGE ecosystem grows:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Network Growth">
    As more users join the network and deploy agents, demand for $SAGE increases
  </Step>
  <Step title="Fee Generation">
    Network activity generates fees, which are used to compensate node providers with a portion burned.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Utility Expansion">
    As new use cases for $SAGE emerge, its utility and demand increase
  </Step>
  <Step title="Ecosystem Development">
    Development funded by SAGEUSD yield enhances the ecosystem, increasing $SAGE's value
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Economic Flywheel

The SAGE ecosystem creates a powerful economic flywheel:

  <Tab title="SAGE vs ETH">
    <div className="space-y-4">
      <p>While Ethereum uses a burn mechanism through EIP-1559, $SAGE takes this further with:</p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6">
        <li>No built-in inflation (unlike ETH's continued issuance)</li>
        <li>Stronger correlation between network usage and token value</li>
        <li>More direct value capture from the utility of AI agents</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="SAGE vs SOL">
    <div className="space-y-4">
      <p>Compared to Solana's token economics, $SAGE offers:</p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6">
        <li>Fixed supply with no inflation (vs SOL's inflation model)</li>
        <li>Value capture from AI agent deployment and usage</li>
        <li>Sustainable funding through SAGEUSD yield rather than token inflation</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Note>
  The $SAGE token economics are designed to create a sustainable, value-accruing asset that benefits all participants in the ecosystem while funding ongoing development through the innovative ISO mechanism rather than token inflation.
