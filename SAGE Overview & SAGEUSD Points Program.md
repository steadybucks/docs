# SAGE: The AI-Native World Computer

\- Decentralized agentic world computer  
\-  Deploys and runs AI agents that execute tasks from plain English commands.    
\- Say “Pay $5 if I’m on time” or “Bet $10 it rains”—smart contracts deploy instantly.    
\- Agents build on agents endlessly, stacking innovations on one unbreakable network.    
\- People add agents, they bring data, and the system scales—everyone profits as it grows.    
\- Replaces coding with talking, servers with agents, and limits with raw potential.  
\- All decentralized platforms so far have a distinction between developers and users. They struggled to build meaningful apps on their platforms. Since SAGE blurs that distinction, anyone can deploy agents or use agents. This results in an explosion of meaningful apps that people use everyday, thereby bringing trillions in value to the network.  
\- $SAGE token will be worth $1T, reaching the coveted mark only after bitcoin.

# Initial Stablecoin Offering

I am going to get insane traction, visibility and hype for Sage by launching SAGEUSD \- a USD backed and regulated stablecoin first. There will be a highly gamified points program for holders of SAGEUSD. I am going to fund the project by generating yield on reserves backing SAGEUSD. This is a new kind of fundraising mechanism called “Initial Stablecoin Offering”. It is a democratized mechanism like ICOs where everyone can participate. But in this mechanism, there is no downside as participants are holding a regulated stablecoin in their own wallets which can be redeemed any time. This is the best fundraising mechanism to ever exist. SAGEUSD will be worth $1T, to be the first stablecoin to reach the coveted mark.

# $SAGE token

$SAGE is the native token of the network. It will have a fixed supply. It will have no inflation unlike other networks like Solana. Network fees and yield from $SAGEUSD will be used to compensate node providers.

$SAGE will be used to secure the network. Node providers need to bond $SAGE to participate in the network. Going offline and rogue behavior will result in slashing the bond. $SAGE is also required to deploy agents to the network. Network fees (similar to gas fees) are also required to be paid in $SAGE. 

In other words, $SAGE will play a similar role as $SOL in the Solana network or $ETH in the Ethereum network.

#  SAGEUSD Points Program

## Overview

SAGEUSD will be minted on Ethereum. Minting can happen via crypto on ramps like moonpay or via converting other cryptos like USDC, ETH to SAGEUSD via Uniswap. Minting can also happen via our partner Brale. Points will get converted to $SAGE tokens once the network launches.

## Points

- 1 point per SAGEUSD held  
- Minimum balance to earn points: 5000 SAGEUSD  
- No maximum cap  
- Everyday a fixed number of points are distributed proportionally among all SAGEUSD holders with the minimum balance and above.  
  - Example: Lets say total market cap of SAGEUSD on the day is 1,000,000,000  
  - Total points available for distribution: 1,000,000  
  - A user with a 100,000 SAGEUSD balance will get: (100,000/1,000,000,000)\*1,000,000 \= 100 points  
  - Any leftover points (points that are allocated but not eligible for distribution because the total market cap comprises balances from people with \<5000 SAGEUSD) will be rolled over to the next day.  
    - For instance, if 100,000 points are leftover from day 1, total points available on day 2 will be 1,100,000.  
- Points are distributed everyday at a random hour  
  - For instance on Day 1 \- at 1PM Dubai Time  
  - On day 2 \- at 5PM Dubai time  
  - On day 3 \- 8 AM Dubai time  
  - This randomization prevents people from acquiring SAGEUSD just before points distribution and selling right after   
- Early adopter point multipliers based on SAGEUSD marketcaps:  
  - 0 \- 100M: 3x  
  - 100M \- 500M: 2.5x  
  - 500M \- 1B: 2x  
  - 1B \- 5B: 1.5x  
  - 5B \- 10B: 1.25x  
  - 10B+: 1x  
- Early adopter point multipliers based on time:  
  - First 30 days: 3x  
  - 30 \- 60 days: 2.5x  
  - 60-90 days: 2x  
  - 90-120 days: 1.5x  
  - 120-180 days: 1.25x  
  - 180 days+: 1x
