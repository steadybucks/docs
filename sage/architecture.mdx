## Technical Overview

SAGE will be built on an architecture that combines the best aspects of blockchain technology with advanced AI capabilities. This unique design enables the platform to process natural language inputs and convert them into executable smart contracts and decentralized applications.

## Agent Deployment Process

<Steps>
  <Step title="Agent Creation">
    Developers or users create an agent using natural language specifications
  </Step>
  <Step title="Validation">
    The network validates the agent's code and resource requirements
  </Step>
  <Step title="Deployment">
    The agent is deployed to the network after paying the required $SAGE fee
  </Step>
  <Step title="Execution">
    The agent runs on the network, interacting with users and other agents
  </Step>
  <Step title="Monitoring & Updates">
    Agents can be monitored and updated by their creators
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Network Fees

Similar to gas fees on other blockchain networks, SAGE requires network fees for various operations:
