## What is SAGE?

SAGE is a decentralized agentic world computer that transforms how we interact with technology.
Unlike traditional blockchain platforms that require coding knowledge,
SAGE allows users to deploy and run AI agents that execute tasks from plain English commands.


<Note>
  SAGE replaces coding with talking, servers with agents, and limits with raw potential.
  This results in an explosion of meaningful apps that people use every day, thereby bringing trillions in value to the network.

  <Card title="Natural Language Interface" icon="comments" color="#0891b2">
    Say "Pay 5 SAGEUSD if I'm on time" or "Bet 10 SAGEUSD it rains"—smart contracts deploy instantly without any coding required.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Composable Agents" icon="cubes" color="#7c3aed">
    Agents build on agents endlessly, stacking innovations on one unbreakable network, creating a powerful ecosystem of compounding innovation.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Community-Driven Growth" icon="users" color="#c2410c">
    People add agents, they bring data, and the system scales—everyone profits as it grows, creating a virtuous cycle of adoption and value creation.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Democratized Development" icon="code" color="#3b82f6">
    All decentralized platforms so far have a distinction between developers and users. SAGE blurs that distinction, thanks to its natural language interface, allowing anyone to deploy or use agents.

## The Vision

SAGE aims to create an explosion of meaningful applications that people use every day, thereby bringing trillions in value to the network. By removing the technical barriers to entry, SAGE enables anyone to create and deploy smart contracts and decentralized applications through simple conversation.
